OpenTorque

This project is inspired by TORQUE Resource Manager, which was developed by
Adaptive Computing Enterprises, Inc. as a fork of OpenPBS v2.3. OpenPBS was
originally developed by NASA Ames Research Center, Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, and Veridian Information Solutions, Inc.

OpenTorque is a clean-room reimplementation in Go. It does not contain any
code from TORQUE or OpenPBS, but implements compatible protocols and interfaces
to serve as a modern, cross-platform replacement.
